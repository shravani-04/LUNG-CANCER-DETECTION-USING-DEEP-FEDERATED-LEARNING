# Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect lung cancer using a deep learning model trained on a dataset of lung images. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it can classify lung images into different categories, such as adenocarcinoma (lung_aca), normal (lung_n), and squamous cell carcinoma (lung_scc).

## 1. Introduction

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving treatment outcomes. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning for automated lung cancer detection using medical images.

## 2. Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images" dataset, publicly available on Kaggle. It consists of a large collection of histopathological images of lung and colon tissues, classified into different cancer types and normal tissues.

- **Source:** Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images dataset
- **Preprocessing:** Images are resized, normalized, and augmented using ImageDataGenerator to improve model generalization.

## 3. Model Architecture

The deep learning model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, a flattening layer, and dense layers for classification. The final layer uses a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class.

## 4. Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the training set of the dataset, and its performance is evaluated on a separate test set. Metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's effectiveness. The training process utilizes techniques like data augmentation and dropout to prevent overfitting and enhance performance.

## 5. Prediction and Results

After training, the model can be used to predict the class of new lung images. The model outputs probabilities for each class, and the class with the highest probability is considered the predicted class. The results are presented in the form of a confusion matrix and a classification report, providing insights into the model's performance across different classes.

## 6. Federated Learning

This project explores the application of federated learning to train the lung cancer detection model. Federated learning allows multiple devices or clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their data directly, enhancing privacy and data security. The Flower framework is used to implement federated learning in this project.

## 7. Gradio Interface

A user-friendly interface is created using Gradio to facilitate interaction with the model. The interface allows users to upload lung images and receive predictions in real-time. It provides visualizations such as the confusion matrix and classification report for a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.

## 8. Usage

1. Clone this repository to your Colab environment.
2. Upload the dataset to your Google Drive or import it using Kaggle API.
3. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.
4. Use the Gradio interface to predict the class of new lung images.

## 9. Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- scikit-learn

## 10. Limitations

- The performance of the model is limited by the quality and size of the dataset.
- The model may not generalize well to images outside the dataset distribution.
- Federated learning implementation may have limitations regarding communication efficiency and scalability.

## 11. Future Work

- Explore different model architectures and hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Incorporate more advanced data augmentation techniques.
